# Technical Writing Assignment

For guidance on setting up and submitting this assignment, refer to the Marcy lab School Docs How-To guide for [Working with Short Response and Coding Assignments](https://marcylabschool.gitbook.io/marcy-lab-school-docs/fullstack-curriculum/how-tos/working-with-assignments#how-to-work-on-assignments).

## Prompt 1

Imagine you are teaching a friend about OOP. They mainly want to understand what is Encapsulation. Write a brief lesson on Encapsulation that includes the following:

- What is encapsulation?
- What major goal does this help to achieve in software engineering?
- Give an example (in code) of encapsulation.
- An explanation of how the code example demonstrates encapsulation

### Response 1

## Prompt 2

The following `friendsManager` object is an example of an interface that is **NOT** consistent and predictable:

```js
const friendsManager = {
  friends: [],
  addFriend(newFriend) {
    if (typeof newFriend !== "string") return;
    this.friends.push(newFriend);
  },
};

friendsManager.addFriend("daniel");
friendsManager.addFriend(true);
friendsManager.friends.push("emmaneul");
friendsManager.friends.push(42);
```

Explain how the code is not consistent or predictable, then provide an example in code that uses closure to make it more consistent and predictable.

### Response 2

## Prompt 3

With OOP in JavaScript, it's possible to use factory functions to achieve encapsulation and re-use them to make objects that look alike. However, factory functions have drawbacks and we often use classes instead.

How would you explain to a budding developer what the drawbacks of using factory functions are and why it is better to use classes instead?

### Response 3

- While with both factory functions and classes allows for users to create objects that hold information that can be repeated and reused.
  When using a factory function it works as a function that will create not only a new object but recreates the same methods as well. This only leads to an increased and unnecessary use of storage.
  It would be better for a user to use a class not only for the amount of storage saved but when creating a new instance, the methods will be inherited allowing subclasses to have access and draw from the main class.

## Prompt 4

Do some research on the history of when / how classes were introduced into JavaScript and share your findings. Your response should include:

- What version of JavaScript were classes introduced in and when did it come out?
- Why were classes introduced into JavaScript?

### Response 4

- Classes was first introduced in 2015 during the ECMAScript 6 update, which was a second major revision to JavaScript.
  Classes where first created as a template to create multiple objects

## Prompt 5

OOP can still be achieved in JavaScript without using the `class` keyword and instead using the "Constructor Functions" and the "Prototype Chain" (look them up!)

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function () {
  return `Hi, I'm ${this.name}, and I'm ${this.age} years old.`;
};

const alice = new Person("Alice", 30);
console.log(alice.greet());
```

Provide one point that advocates for the use of this syntax and then provide a counter-argument for the use of classes instead.

### Response 5
